1. What is String and Why is it immutable?
Ans: 
  - Immutable objects means once it is created, it will not allow to modify or change the state of object.
  - Generally, String is nothing but the sequence of characters. 
  - In java, String is a class used to create string objects.

  There are two ways to create String object.
  1. String Literal
  2. new operator

  String contant Pool in Heap memory
  - These String object stores in special memory location which is called String constant pool. String pool is a special memory location reserved in Heap memory to store String objects. 

  Why String is immutable?
  - Memory -> Saves a lot of heap memory by JRE. It assigns reference of same string to multiple objects. 
  - Security -> Saves application from security threat. Immutability gives the security of loading the correct class by Classloader.
    E.g All username and password passes as String in applications. If String will not be immutable then hacker can easily change reference of String.
  - Thread safety -> String is thread safe due to immutablity feature.
  
  All wrapper classes are immutable in Java.
